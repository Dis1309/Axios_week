## Introduction

The SecureUserData app is designed to provide users with a secure and efficient way to store and manage their sensitive data using blockchain technology. The app ensures that user data remains tamper-proof and resistant to unauthorized access, thanks to the decentralized and immutable nature of the blockchain.

## Features

- *User Data Storage*: SecureUserData allows users to store their data, such as personal information, financial records, and more, in a structured format.

- *Blockchain Security*: The app integrates advanced blockchain technology to guarantee data security, ensuring that data remains unchanged and traceable over time.

- *Decentralized Access Control*: Users have control over who can access their data, thanks to blockchain-based access control mechanisms.

- *Data Integrity*: By utilizing blockchain's immutability, SecureUserData prevents data tampering and unauthorized modifications.

- *Privacy Enhancement*: The app employs encryption techniques to enhance user data privacy and confidentiality.

## Blockchain Integration

SecureUserData utilizes advanced blockchain features to ensure the highest level of security for user data:

- *Smart Contracts*: The app employs smart contracts to define access rules and automate data-sharing processes securely.

- *Immutable Ledger*: User data is stored in an immutable ledger, making it impossible for anyone to alter historical records.

- *Consensus Mechanisms*: The blockchain's consensus mechanisms enhance the overall integrity of the data stored, preventing malicious activities.

- *Data Hashing*: Each data entry is hashed and linked to the previous entry, forming a secure chain of records that can't be altered.

## Advanced Features

The app leverages advanced features from both Flutter and blockchain technology:

- *Flutter UI/UX*: SecureUserData offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface developed using Flutter, providing a seamless experience across platforms.

- *Real-time Updates*: Users can experience real-time updates and notifications, ensuring they are aware of any access or modification attempts.

- *Biometric Authentication*: To add an extra layer of security, the app supports biometric authentication, making data access convenient yet secure.

- *Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)*: Users can opt for MFA to enhance account security, requiring multiple forms of verification to access their data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with SecureUserData:

### Installation

1. Fork the repository from github: `https://github.com/Dis1309/`
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your username]/Axios_week.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Axios_week`
4. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
5. set up environment variables for frontend - sepolia account private key and public key as well as alchemy sepolia rpcurl and wsurl
NOTE - One private key can make only one Aadhar card 

### Usage

1. Launch the app on your preferred device or simulator: `flutter run`
2. Create a new account or log in to your existing account.
3. Explore the app's features, store your data, and experience the power of blockchain security.

## Future Vision

1. As our app only supports the data of aadhaar for now, we are looking forward to store the data of voterid, driving license in future.
2. Our Motto is about to secure the data as far as possible, We are looking forward to add more Authentication features, near future.
like police verification whose backend smart contracts are ready.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute to SecureUserData, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature-new-feature`
3. Develop and test your feature.
4. Commit and push your changes: `git commit -am 'Add new feature' && git push origin feature-new-feature`
5. Create a pull request detailing your changes.


## Problem faced
We initially planned to integrate metamask for connecting and creating aadhar but due to limited time , that integration couldn't take place due to which private key has to be used for now as an env variable.

## Smart Contract
Deployed on Sepolia Testnet
